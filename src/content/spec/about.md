# About me
![Rat](/images/Test/rat.webp)

My name is **Tyler**, though most people online know me as Anticupid. I’m from Florida so yes, that means I’m technically a “Florida Man,” but luckily, I haven’t made the news yet (let’s try to keep it that way).

Over the past year and a half, I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out my goals and long-term direction in life. That journey led me to Information Technology, and I’ve been fully committed ever since. I’m currently pursuing an Associate’s degree in Information Technology at Keiser university, and while the experience has had its ups and downs, it’s also opened the door to something I’m truly passionate about: Cybersecurity.

Before this, I never considered myself a particularly passionate person. Most things didn’t hold my attention unless they were in a video game. But discovering cybersecurity changed that. For the first time, I found something that constantly challenges me, excites me, and drives me to keep learning.

## Why CyberSecurity?

I could talk about this all day, but I’ll keep it brief. What draws me most to cybersecurity is that it’s a field that never stands still. You have to keep learning, adapting, and evolving or you’ll fall behind. That constant push for growth is exactly what motivates me.

At my current warehouse job, the work is repetitive and each day feels the same, just with different amounts of work. Cybersecurity is the complete opposite. Every problem is unique, every challenge tests your creativity, and there’s always something new to uncover.

My favorite area so far is the **offensive side**, penetration testing and ethical hacking where the goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before real attackers can. Still, I also have a deep appreciation for the defensive side of cybersecurity, where the focus is on protecting systems, detecting threats, and strengthening security postures.

Currently, my main focus is on **web penetration testing and exploitation**. Every organization relies on web applications or websites, and securing them is critical. I can’t say exactly where my obsession with web security came from since it feels like a calling, but I’ve been dedicating myself to mastering it. This curiosity has also led me into the world of bug bounty hunting, which I plan to write more about soon.

### What have I done?

As a lifelong gamer, one of my biggest personal achievements was deciding to uninstall all of my games to fully dedicate myself to my career goals. Gaming has been a huge part of my life since I was five years old. It has helped me make friends all around the world, but now it’s time to focus on building my future.

So far, I’ve self-taught myself the fundamentals of IT and cybersecurity, going beyond textbooks and exams to apply what I’ve learned through hands-on practice. I actively use platforms such as **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, PentesterLab, and HackerOne (CTF)** to test my skills and simulate real world security challenges.

In addition, I’ve set up and secured physical devices like a **Raspberry Pi**, using it to experiment with various systems and configurations. Some of my recent projects include building a **Network Attached Storage (NAS)** system and developing the foundation of my own website.

My journey is still in its early stages, but I have no plans to slow down. I’m determined to keep learning, experimenting, and improving until I reach my goals.
