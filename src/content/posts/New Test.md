# Welcome to the blog!

This site will be my main base for anything in general that I have learned until I can get my dream website running. It will take alot of love and work for me to get my dream site finished so until then I will be using this one! 

Anyways this pinned blog is just a small introduction to who I am, in case you have no idea how to navigate a website :D

Below are some quick things to know about me.

## WhoAmI?
```
[Anticupids]——[10.10.10.10]——[~]
[*]$ whoami
Anticupid
```
Online I go as Anticupid and you can abbreviate it any way you want, whether you say "Anti", "Cupid", "Antee", "Coopid", doesn't really matter to me since I am fine with whatever makes people comfortable. So anyways my online handle is Anticupid and my real name is Tyler. I am currently enrolled in Keiser University finishing up my Associates in Information Technology. In my free time I use it either watching youtube videos or learning more about Cyber Security.
