# Appreciating everyone.
I want to take a moment to sincerely thank everyone on my team, Bytestorm. In particular, 0dv & r34w0k3n otherwise known as Dave & r34, your encouragement and motivation inspire me every single day to strive for a better future and to do something meaningful with my life, instead of just drifting through the days. We’ve all faced challenges & team merges, break-ups, and transitions, but the team we have now feels perfect. You all ignite a fire in me to keep pushing toward my goals.

I also want to express my gratitude to the people I look up to. Every day, as I hang out in Discord, goof around, and share moments with the community, I see the incredible effort and progress that others are putting into their skills and their lives. It’s comforting and motivating to witness people dedicating countless hours, often with little sleep, to achieve their dreams.

My journey in cybersecurity began simply by lurking in a YouTuber’s Discord channel. From there, I joined the HTB and THM communities, and through these spaces, I met all of these amazing people as well as so many more. While I know I still have a lot to learn and improve upon, I am confident that with everyone by my side, I will achieve my goals.

It’s truly remarkable how much you can grow and learn just by interacting with people from different cultures and backgrounds. If you’re ever nervous or overwhelmed by this field, know that you’re not alone and that there are many who face the same struggles. While there may be egotistical people along the way that will gatekeep the field, don’t let them discourage you. Keep pushing forward, find those who support your growth, and cherish the connections you make. These people aren’t just resources, they’re friends you can rely on.

## The future of the site!

I’m not sure how often I’ll be posting here, but I promise to do my best in sharing content and presenting it in a way that’s meaningful to others. For now, this site will serve as a hub for blogs and posts, but I have bigger plans in store. My dream site will eventually be full of exciting features, hidden surprises, and a lot of other fun stuff, but until that vision is complete, I hope you all enjoy what’s here.

Wishing everyone a wonderful day, and may you find moments of peace and joy even amidst the challenges of the world we live in.
